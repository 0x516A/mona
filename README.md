Want to contribute ?
--------------------

I am still in the middle of switching over to github as the primary source.
Until that happens, I recommend to create a username on redmine.corelan.be and open a ticket at http://redmine.corelan.be/projects/mona/issues
Simply attach your patch/diff file to the ticket and I'll test & merge the changes.

Please use hard tabs, not spaces.  I know, I know, I'll move to spaces when I have more time.

Thanks !!
